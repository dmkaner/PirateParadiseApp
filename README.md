Android / iOS Unity 2D maze solving game! First game I created

When opening on local machine, make sure to open project in the Unity application. There may be some performance
issues with the emulator so I suggest that you connect your phone and use that as an emulator. The game does run 
on iOS so if you want to connect your iPhone you can play the game there aswell, although it is not optimized
for older models.

Game on Google Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DarkMatterCreations.PiratesParadise&hl=en
